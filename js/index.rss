Take the hidden entrance from the Uffizi Museum and follow the stairs up to the overhead passageway. The corridor stretches for nearly a kilometre along the river, all the way to the Ponte Vecchio.</p><p>The private passageway was originally constructed in 1564 by Giergio Vasari. The Medicis used it to walk between their residence at Palazzo Pitti and the Palazzo Vecchio.</p><p>Nowadays, the hallway houses an extensive collection of self-portraits by master painters from the sixteenth through to the twentieth century.</p><h3 id="lampredotto">Lampredotto</h3><p>Lampredotto is a cow's stomach boiled in a flavoursome broth of onion, herbs, tomatoes and carrots. This tender meat is served in a special bun that has been dipped in the broth (called a ‘semelle’) along with a good helping of salsa verde.</p><p>If you are looking for authentic experiences, trying Lampredotto at a street stall is one of the best. Florence tours offer the perfect opportunity to go for it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A stylish comeback with floral creations made by Sebastian Flowers, and handmade boxes designed by Migone Confetti Firenze.

Nonprofits need to be aware of the link between a brand's strategic value and its organizational impact.</p><p>Here are a few things that can happen if you don’t put the time and effort into creating this simple yet powerful statement: * You’ll probably be confused with similar organizations. * Your messaging will be all over the place. * Potential donors won’t trust you.</p><p>It’s true that big charities have the benefit of a marketing team: the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has a director of global brand and innovation, while UNICEF has a chief of brand-building.</p><p>Fortunately, even if it’s just you, it’s not overly difficult to come up with a positioning statement that will set you apart from your charitable competition. That is, if you’re willing to do some research and deep thinking before you start typing.</p><h3 id="what-is-brand-positioning">What Is Brand Positioning?</h3><p>First, let’s cover the definition of brand positioning. It’s the art of matching your marketing message with the beliefs, feelings and desires of your ideal customer.</p><p>You do that effectively by making yourself “visible” as the kind of organization an individual would be attracted to.</p><p>However, this statement isn’t customer-facing like your tagline is. Think of it as an internal statement that supports ideas before you develop specific marketing messaging.</p><p>It’s also important to remember nonprofit brand positioning is a bit different than for-profit branding. Here’s why statements are different for a charity vs. for a for-profit business: you want people to donate to your cause, but you’re not focused on messaging around the lowest prices like Walmart is, or on the biggest showroom selection like Ikea is. Competitive positioning for nonprofits is more focused on the “why”: what is your mission? Your product is the good you’re doing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="Competitive Positioning for Nonprofits" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@larm?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Larm Rmah</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>For example, UNICEF’s ”why” is “to protect the rights of every child.”</p><p>UNICEF isn’t focused on undercutting their competition or saying they’re the best charity out there. (Also, some charities wish to collaborate and support others in their efforts, not necessarily compete against them.)</p><h3 id="how-to-create-a-non-for-profit-positioning-statement">How to Create a Non-For-Profit Positioning Statement</h3><p>Now that we’ve clarified the difference, let’s look at how to create your nonprofit positioning statement:</p><p>Define your unique selling proposition (USP).</p><p>It’s great that there are so many nonprofits supporting various causes, but this means that people are faced with an overwhelming number to choose from. You want them to pick yours.</p><p>While you’re not selling a product, you are selling a commitment—whether that’s to provide clean water to villages or save turtles from extinction. Your USP is something unique that you have to offer.</p><p>Like a small business owner does competitive research before defining his or her brand, you need to do the same for your charitable organization. Conduct some research on similar charities and find out: * Who’s their audience? * How are they positioning their brand? * What are they doing well? * What are they doing poorly?</p><p>Here’s one of the ways that charity:water sets themselves apart from other similar nonprofits. They don’t focus solely on the fact that they provide clean drinking water to underdeveloped countries. They highlight that they prove every project “with GPS coordinates and remote sensors to ensure water is always flowing.” Don’t be afraid to be bold.</p><p>Think of creative ways to encourage potential donors to give to your cause. A website with a few lackluster paragraphs and a donate button isn’t going to cut it. Neither is a bunch of copy that has the same messaging as similar charities.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113630400-ea4288922497?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="Competitive Positioning for Nonprofits" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113630400-ea4288922497?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113630400-ea4288922497?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113630400-ea4288922497?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113630400-ea4288922497?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jmuniz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Joel Muniz</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, nonprofits have focused on safe, neutral messaging; that’s changed now. Just look at F...k Cancer, a health organization working for early detection and prevention of cancer worldwide!</p><p>While you don’t need to use expletives in your nonprofit brand positioning statement, tagline, logo or other materials, think outside “we do good” messaging and be a bit edgy.</p><h3 id="tell-your-full-story-">Tell your full story.</h3><p>Don’t make potential donors try and figure out why they should support your initiative. Spend some time thinking deeply about your nonprofit positioning statement as it relates to your story.</p><p>Did a family member deal with the disease you’re raising funds to eradicate? Make it personal. Did you become passionate about animal rights when you adopted a pet from a shelter? Consider that angle. Take a look at your About Us page for inspiration. Here’s a local dog rescue’s story that is part of everything they do.</p><p>Create a narrative around your brand rather than only focusing on what you do.

One option is to install sheer curtains, which allow you to let in plenty of light but they also allow you to decide how much privacy you want. The natural light will flood into your home, and brighten up the space. If you don’t have windows, try mimicking natural light through your lighting choices. Adding plants can add a lot of benefits</p><p>Not only do plants go a long way towards bringing the outdoors inside, they actually improve the air quality in the room they’re in, they can help you relax, they can provide inspiration, and they’ve been shown to help people focus. Get rid of clutter and see big changes</p><p>Feng Shui principles say that the more cluttered a room is, the more distractions a person will have. If you want to boost your productivity and get rid of many of the distractions of your life, then decluttering is a smart spot to begin. Likewise, ensuring that there are paths throughout your home without obstacles is supposed to be a big help in increasing productivity. Remind yourself of your goals through your décor.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xo6KPohaTrc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Try finding tributes to the goals and passions you have, and put them throughout your home. Ideally, you’d put tributes in the room in which the goal would be accomplished. For example, if you want to write a novel, then you might place a tribute to that novel in your office. Positive thoughts are more likely when positive ideas are surrounding you. Mix textures and patterns</p><p>Many people think of Feng Shui as a way to simplify décor and thought that is true, it’s also true that it’s a lot more than that. It also encourages people to mix and match textures, patterns, and colors. For example, patterned silk curtains may be a good to a room in which there are many solid colored accessories.</p><p>At Half Price Drapes, we believe there are millions of ways to decorate a home but that there’s no substitute for quality.

The guide is also well versed with all the unique medical problems which may occur with elevation. Light headiness, nausea, fatigue and head ache. Sometimes the sole remedy is to descend to a lower elevation or to stay in exactly the same altitude until the person feels better. This might occur after a good sleep. Sometimes some drugs such as aspirin or in more severe situations a stronger medication may be used to reduce the symptoms.</p><p>In extreme situations, the individual who is really ill with altitude illness has to be escorted down to a lower altitude with a porter who will subsequently bring them pack up to connect the main group after he symptoms have come under control. But some pre trip preparation goes a very long ways. Understanding of the language and the customs is excellent to have. Just getting into a trekking trailhead could possibly be an adventure completely into itself.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get to Know the Vessels for Barge Trips in France]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Planning to set off on one of the excellent barge trips in France?

The décor, furnishings, artwork and ambience are often reflective of the regions through which they travel on their itineraries. While some are warm and rustic in their appeal, others are luxurious and sophisticated, with elegant furnishings. The class of barge will depend on your budget and the itinerary you choose, but there really is something for all tastes and all are extremely comfortable and well facilitated.</p><p><strong>The Accommodation</strong></p><p>Depending on which of the barge trips in France you choose, you’ll be faced with a range of on-board accommodation options. As a guide, some may feature luxurious staterooms and others will offer well-appointed junior suites and cosy double or twin cabins, all with ensuites. Many have luxury extras like under floor heating, as well as air-conditioning and individually controlled heating.</p><p>The shared areas provide the same intimate, friendly ambience in their saloons and cocktail bars, dining areas, libraries and reading nooks, while up on deck there’s often an open air heated spa and sun deck, as well as al fresco drinking and dining areas.</p><p><strong>The Service</strong></p><p>If you travel with a reputable operator, the service on board these vessels is what they are most renowned for. With an attentive crew to cater to the small group numbers, they go above and beyond in their commitment to providing the best experience for their guests. Every crew member, from the chefs, hosts and hostesses to the captain, is there to discreetly, yet attentively ensure you want for nothing.</p><p>This is what true relaxation is all about: gourmet food and wine, warm, friendly service and all those little extras that mean you can really relax, without having to worry about any of the details.</p><p><strong>Get Off and Cycle!</strong></p><p>While you may well be tempted to simply take advantage of the on-board facilities of the hotel barge, there could be times you want to expend some energy. Because the barges travel very closely to the towpaths that run alongside the canals and waterways, a really lovely thing to do is to disembark and cycle alongside the vessel. To this end, most of the barges have a number of bikes on-board for guest use, so you can get off and cycle at your own pace and meet up in the next village along if you like! There’s absolutely no chance of getting lost and the towpaths are flat, well kept and often shaded. It’s a great way to stretch your legs and work up an appetite for lunch or dinner on-board.</p><p><strong>No Compromise on Comfort</strong></p><p>Just because barge trips in France don’t involve those huge cruise ships with all their bells and whistles doesn’t mean you have to compromise on comfort or quality. In fact, it’s the total opposite: these gorgeous river going vessels have everything you need (and more) with the added bonus of charm, character and authenticity. There really is no better way to explore the more off the beaten path parts of the country – so get on board!</p><h3 id="author-plate">Author Plate</h3><p><em>Paul Newman is the Marketing and E-Systems Executive for European Waterways, the UK's most respected provider of all-inclusive, luxury <a href="https://www.europeanwaterways.com/blog/best-insider-experiences-barge-trips-france-part-1/"><strong>barge trips in France</strong></a>.

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p><p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p><p>In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."</p><p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p><blockquote>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.</blockquote><p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p><p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p><p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.

Herbin's radical reliefs of simple geometric forms in painted wood, such as <em>Colored Wood Relief</em> (1921; Paris, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou">Musée National d'Art Moderne</a>), challenged not only the status of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easel">easel painting</a> but also traditional figure–ground relationships. The incomprehension that greeted these reliefs and related furniture designs, even from those critics most favorably disposed towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism">Cubism</a>, was such that until 1926 or 1927 he followed Rosenberg's advice to return to a representational style and produced paintings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity">New Objectivity</a> style.</p><p>Auguste Herbin, Galerie de L’Effort Moderne, March 1918</p><p>Herbin himself later disowned his landscapes, still lifes and genre scenes of this period, such as <em>Bowls Players</em> (1923; Paris, Musée National d'Art Moderne), in which the objects were depicted as schematized volumes. Under the influence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism">surrealism</a>, he became increasingly critical of the rational forms employed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl">De Stijl</a>.

Art non figurativ</em>. In the second issue of the journal he wrote against the rising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">Fascism</a> and oppression of all kinds.

Critical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, he left the Communist party in the 1940s.</p><p>Beginning in 1942, Herbin developed a language of form and color, his "alphabet plastique". Increasingly, his paintings consist only of colorful arrangements of triangles, circles and rectangles. In 1946 he was one of the founders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_des_R%C3%A9alit%C3%A9s_Nouvelles">Salon des Réalités Nouvelles</a>, a successor of Abstraction-Création.

It deals with the final year in the life of its main character, Henry Earlforward, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miser">miser</a> with a slight limp, who keeps a second-hand bookshop in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a> area of London, at Riceyman Steps. Henry harbours a secret passion for Violet Arb, a widow who inherits a neighbouring confectionery shop. When Henry tries to woo Violet, the widow realizes that they share the same charwoman and maid servant in the simple, loyal Elsie Sprickett.</p><p>When Elsie’s boyfriend, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_shock">shell-shocked</a> war veteran Joe, loses self-control and runs after Violet with a carving-knife at her shop, Henry gallantly intervenes after Violet approaches Henry for help. Violet, who sees in Henry a financially secure future, finally decides to marry him after a short courtship. Joe, meanwhile, disappears after writing a letter to Elsie that he will come for her when he has recovered from his traumatic disorder.</p><p>Henry's parsimony drives the married couple into an increasingly wretched existence. He is aghast, for example, when Violet spends fourteen pounds vacuuming his dusty shop as a wedding present. He begins eating less and less, even forgoing meat for cheese, and refuses to go to the hospital to treat his undernourishment when the doctor and his wife insist that he does. All the while Elsie stands devoted to the couple, despite having problems of her own—she pines secretly for Joe, and pilfers food to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating">binge eat</a> at night.</p><p>Their lives—in which Henry’s passion for money and his obstinacy finally consume himself and his wife—are contrasted to that of their loyal maid servant Elsie Sprickett, and it is the latter, despite her extreme poverty, who brings life and a future to the bittersweet tale.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cat</strong> having made acquaintance with a mouse, professed such great love and friendship for her, that the mouse at last agreed that they should live and keep house together.</p><p>"We must make provision for the winter," said the cat, "or we shall suffer hunger, and you, little mouse, must not</p>]]></description><link>http://64.227.54.30/household-stories-by-the-brothers-grimm/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f76c9ad025a8733be244d8e</guid><category><![CDATA[Stories]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sal]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 20:20:10 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601568544995-bbf065673ab4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601568544995-bbf065673ab4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm"><p><strong>Cat</strong> having made acquaintance with a mouse, professed such great love and friendship for her, that the mouse at last agreed that they should live and keep house together.</p><p>"We must make provision for the winter," said the cat, "or we shall suffer hunger, and you, little mouse, must not stir out, or you will be caught in a trap."</p><p>So they took counsel together and bought a little pot of fat. And then they could not tell where to put it for safety, but after long consideration the cat said there could not be a better place than the church, for nobody would steal there; and they would put it under the altar and not touch it until they were really in want.

Most of the "brethren" think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.</p><p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the legitimate goals of his life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arnAD8I7msQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601498869822-d5a7b7e57199?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="To discern the true from the false" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601498869822-d5a7b7e57199?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601498869822-d5a7b7e57199?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601498869822-d5a7b7e57199?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601498869822-d5a7b7e57199?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lackingnothing?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Parker Coffman</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p><p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p><p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p><p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate.

Among them was Ignác Kúnos (1860-1945), who compiled this volume of Turkish fairytales in the same tradition. A Hungarian-born linguist, Kúnos also had an interest in the Turkish dialect and folk tradition, and collected several volumes of oral fairytales, not through reading and study, but by travelling around the Turkish country and listening to storytellers.</p><p>In this elaborately produced volume, beautifully illustrated by Willy Pogany, Kúnos describes the stories as being closer to the fairytales of European tradition than those in Arabian Nights, seeking to dissuade his readers of any notion of Orientalism. However, the fact that these tales are thematically similar to their Western counterparts — containing stories of princesses and dragons, witches and white horses, heroes and villains — should not be surprising to any frequent reader of fairytales. They are so often, in some way, international.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBiu1Emv31Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>One striking element of these tales from Turkey is the frequent presence of the over-sized supernatural beings referred to as “Dews” (or on occasion simply “Arabs”!) — known elsewhere in Islamic folklore as “Devis” or “Jin” (Europeanized as “Genie”). With their towering form their closest cognate in the European tradition would be the figure of the giant, with some fairy-like elements thrown in for good measure. Like giants they are normally malevolent towards humans, but are sometimes friendly and helpful.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost is designed for ambitious publishers]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome, it's great to have you here.
